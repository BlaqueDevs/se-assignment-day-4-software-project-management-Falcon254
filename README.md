# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?Timely delivery ensures customer satisfaction, prevents cost overruns, and maintains a competitive edge.
To ensure deadlines are met, project managers can:
Set clear milestones and realistic deadlines.
Use Agile methodologies for flexibility.
Monitor progress with tools like Gantt charts.
Identify risks early and allocate buffer time.

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?Prevents financial losses, ensures sustainability, and increases ROI.
Strategies to prevent budget overruns:
Use cost estimation techniques (e.g., bottom-up budgeting).
Monitor expenses with real-time dashboards
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?Agile: Iterative, flexible, customer feedback-driven.
 Faster adaptability, continuous delivery.
 Harder to predict costs/time, needs strong team collaboration.
Waterfall: Sequential, structured, clear documentation.
 Clear scope, easier cost estimation.
 Less flexibility, risk of late-stage failure.


## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?Agile: Best for dynamic projects needing frequent changes.
Example: Mobile app with evolving features.
Waterfall: Best for fixed-scope projects with regulatory requirements.
Example: Banking software with strict com
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?Implement automated & manual testing.
Follow coding standards (CI/CD pipelines).
Conduct regular code reviews & security audi
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?Prevents scope creep and aligns expectations.
Work Breakdown Structure (WBS): Breaks a project into manageable tasks, making tracking easier.
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?Helps track progress, allocate resources efficiently.
Gantt charts visually map timelines, dependencies, and workloads.
## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience? for example Jabali App: Supports autistic children with personalized learning.
GBV App: Provides prevention & support mechanisms. my audience therapy and care givers and parents .
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?Ensures the solution meets actual user needs and avoids unnecessary features.
## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?Example for Jabali: "An interactive learning app designed to help children with autism develop essential skills at their own pace."
## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?AI-driven learning adaptation .
Chatbots & emergency response .

## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?The global autism learning solutions market and digital safety apps market are growing, indicating potential demand.
## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?Understanding competitor gaps and emerging tech (e.g., AI in education, cybersecurity for GBV apps) helps refine features.
